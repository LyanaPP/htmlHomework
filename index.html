    <h1>Golden Globes 2024: Let's hope the Oscars can provide more fun</h1>

    <p>In a year that was supposed to reinvent the scandal-hit awards, the Golden Globes played it safe. But with an
        unfunny
        host and no entertainment factor, they were "just plain dull".</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was the truest moment the television cameras captured at the Golden Globes: an unidentified woman sat at a
        table and
        let out a giant yawn. This year was meant to reinvent the awards, which were nearly destroyed when a 2021 Los
        Angeles
        Times report found lack of diversity and accusations of corruption in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,
        the group
        behind the Globes at the time. But the reconstituted group running things now couldn't have intended the event
        to be so
        earnest and just plain dull, from Jo Koy, the blandest, least funny host in recent memory, to the sober, safe
        acceptance
        speeches. There were no political statements, no drunken rambling, no jaw-dropping surprises among winners and
        losers,
        all the things that made the old show at least fun to watch. Without the entertainment factor, it's easier to
        see the
        Golden Globes for what they are: a campaign stop on the way to the Oscars.</p>

    <p>The top Oscars, for best director and best picture, are widely seen as a race between Nolan and Oppenheimer v
        Scorsese
        and Killers of the Flower Moon, which did go head-to-head at the Globes. Nolan's win for director and
        Oppenheimer's for
        best drama would seem to give them the edge. But, reality check: last year, The Banshees of Inisherin and The
        Fabelmans
        won in comedy and drama categories and lost the Oscar to Everything Everywhere All At Once. Spielberg won the
        Globe for
        directing but lost to the Daniels. The Globes are not always good predictors of the Oscars.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If the mere perception of winning helps a campaign anyway, being labelled a loser can hurt. That is bad news for
        Bradley
        Cooper, whose Maestro, once considered a major awards contender, did not win a single Golden Globe. Cooper
        looked
        crestfallen at the end of Nolan's acceptance speech.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Barbie, which had nine nominations, more than any other film, lost all the big prizes. Billie Eilish and Finneas
        O'Connell's What Was I Made For? won best original song and the film won a new award the Globes made up this
        year for
        cinematic and box office achievement, for a movie that earned more than $150 million. In 2018 the Oscars
        announced a
        similar "most popular film" category, which was so ridiculed it was scrapped before it even happened, but the
        Globes
        shamelessly went for it. None of that reads as Oscar momentum.</p>

        The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) was founded in 1943 as the Hollywood Foreign Correspondent
        Association(HFCA) by Los Angelesâ€“based foreign journalists seeking to develop a better-organized process of
        gathering and
        distributing cinema news to non-U.S. markets.[6][7][8][9] One of the organization's first major endeavors was to
        establish a ceremony similar to the Academy Awards to honor film achievements. The 1st Golden Globe Awards,
        honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, were held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios.
        Subsequent
        ceremonieswere held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel and the
        Hollywood
        Roosevelt
        Hotel.</p>

        The broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards, telecast to 167 countries worldwide, generally ranks as the third
        most-watched
        awards show each year, behind only the Oscars and the Grammy Awards. Since 2010, it was televised live in all
        United
        States time zones. Until Ricky Gervais hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major Hollywood award
        ceremonies (the other being the Screen Actors Guild Awards) that did not have a regular host; every year a
        different
        presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th
        Golden
        Globe Awards the next two years.[41] Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards
        in 2013
        through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and
        songwriter Yoshiki Hayashi.[citation needed]</p>
